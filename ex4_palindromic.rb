# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome 
#made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


#I know:
#--For 3 digits, it's a product below 1,000,000. (1*10**(num*2))
#----So, decrement by 1 until we find it.
#--The multipliers are 999 or below. Or, (1*10**(num))-1
#----Multiplication goes by:
#------99*98 decrement by one
#------98*98 equal each other
#------98*97 decrement by one
#--To check for palindromic:  123.to_s == 123.to_s.reverse
